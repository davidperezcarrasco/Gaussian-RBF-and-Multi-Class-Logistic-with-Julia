# Gaussian-RBF-and-Multi-Class-Logistic-with-Julia
In this assignment, I implemented Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) and Multiclass Logistic Regression with softmax classification using Julia. Focused on classification techniques within machine learning and data mining, the project explored the application of these algorithms for predictive modeling and analysis tasks.
